# Shielder: On-the-Fly DDoS Protection Proxy

## I. Overview

Shielder is a lightweight, high-performance reverse proxy designed to mitigate DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks. It dynamically detects and mitigates malicious traffic patterns, providing real-time protection for your applications. Shielder offers features such as IP-based rate limiting, geo-blocking, blacklist/whitelist management, and dynamic rule generation, all while providing comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities.

## II. Architecture

Shielder employs a robust architecture built using a combination of technologies optimized for performance and scalability:

- **Backend:** Golang (for concurrency and efficient networking)
- **Frontend (Optional):** Next.js (React-based analytics dashboard)
- **Database:** Redis (for fast in-memory data storage of blacklists and IP tracking)
- **Deployment:** Docker + Kubernetes (for horizontal scaling and easy deployment)
- **Observability:** Prometheus and Grafana (for comprehensive monitoring and alerting)

## III. Core Features

- **Traffic Management & Rate Limiting:**
  - IP-based rate limiting
  - Geo-blocking
  - Blacklist and whitelist management
  - Dynamic rule generation for abusive traffic patterns
- **Real-Time Monitoring & Alerting:**
  - Request metrics (rate, latency, error rate)
  - Customizable alerts (Slack, email, etc.)
  - Live traffic dashboard (optional Next.js frontend)
- **Observability & Logging:**
  - Structured JSON logs with trace IDs
  - Prometheus integration for metric visualization in Grafana
  - Log export capabilities

## IV. Setup

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Docker and Kubernetes installed.
2. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
3. **Build the Docker image:** `docker build -t shielder .`
4. **Deploy to Kubernetes:** (Instructions will be provided in a separate Kubernetes deployment file)
5. **Configure:** Adjust settings in `configs/config.yaml` as needed.

## V. Usage

Once deployed, Shielder will automatically begin monitoring and protecting your application. The optional Next.js dashboard provides real-time insights into traffic patterns, blocked IPs, and system health.
